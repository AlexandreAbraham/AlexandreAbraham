I’m a researcher and engineer working on what falls under my hands like tabular deep learning, bias correction in medical studies, and active learning. Currently building open-source tools at [Neuralk‑AI](https://github.com/Neuralk-AI).

### 🚀 Current work: Neuralk‑AI

- **[TabBench](https://github.com/Neuralk-AI/TabBench/)** – Benchmark suite for real-world tabular ML models: easy plug-in with industrial datasets (e‑commerce, product categorization, etc.)
- **[Neuralk Foundry CE](https://github.com/Neuralk-AI/NeuralkFoundry-CE)** – Modular ML pipelines to support benchmarking, cross-validation, lazy loading, reproducibility.

### 🔬 Bias correction in medical studies

- **[PopMatch](https://github.com/AlexandreAbraham/popmatch)** – Tool for bias correction in observational medical studies.  

### 🎯 Active Learning

- **[Cardinal](https://github.com/dataiku-research/cardinal)** – A metrics‑based active learning framework by Dataiku Research.  
- **[OpenAL](https://github.com/AlexandreAbraham/OpenAL)** – Evaluation and interpretation framework for active learning strategies.
